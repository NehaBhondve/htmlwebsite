<p>Like a flower</p>
“Silently a flower blooms,
In silence it falls away;
Yet here now, at this moment, at this place,
The world of the flower, the whole of
the world is blooming.
This is the talk of the flower, the truth
of the blossom:
The glory of eternal life is fully shining here.”<br>
-Zenkei Shibayama</div>
<div class=child>
<p>Bloom like it</p>
“When over the flowery, sharp pasture’s
edge, unseen, the salt ocean
lifts its form—chicory and daisies
tied, released, seem hardly flowers alone
,whereas
the sea is circled and sways
peacefully upon its plantlike stem.”<br>
-William Carlos William</div>
<div class=child id=two>
<p>Be a flower</p>“As a flower in the garden
Bending toward the sun,
Unfolds it’s tiny petals
One, by one, by one…
So faith expands it’s beauty
Until at last it grows
Into life’s lasting flower…
The heart’s fair perfect rose.”<br>
